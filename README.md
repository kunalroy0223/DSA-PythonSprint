# DSA-PythonSprint

Welcome to my **20-day Python coding challenge** focused on mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**! This repository documents my journey through each day's task, as I strengthen my Python skills and build a solid foundation in DSA.

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

Over the next 20 days, I'll be learning and implementing key concepts of Python and DSA. From understanding basic Python syntax to advanced algorithms like Dynamic Programming and Graph Traversal, this challenge will help me develop practical coding skills.

## 📅 Tasks Breakdown

Each day of the challenge, I focus on a specific task:

- **Day 1:** Python Basics (Printing, Variables, Data Types, Arithmetic)
- **Day 2-5:** Exploring various Python data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- **Day 6-10:** Sorting and searching algorithms
- **Day 11-15:** Implementing Stacks, Queues, and Graph algorithms
- **Day 16-20:** Tackling Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and more

## 💻 How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x recommended).
3. Navigate to each day's folder and run the code using:

   ```bash
   python filename.py
   ```
